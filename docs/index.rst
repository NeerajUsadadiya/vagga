=================================
Welcome to Vagga's documentation!
=================================

Vagga is a tool to create development environments. In particular it is
able to:

* Build container and run program with single command, right after ``git pull``
* Automatically rebuild container if project dependencies change
* Run multiple processes (e.g. application and database) with single command
* Execute network tolerance tests

All this seamlessly works using linux namespaces (or containers).

.. hint:: While vagga is perfect for development environments and to build
   containers, it should not be the tool of choice to run your software in
   production environments.  For example, it does not offer features to
   automatically restart your services when those fail.  For these purposes,
   you could build the containers with vagga and then transfer them into your
   production environment and start them with tools like: docker_, rocket_,
   lxc_, lxd_, runc_, systemd-nspawn_, lithos_ or even chroot_.
